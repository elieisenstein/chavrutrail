## How to resume in a new Chat (IMPORTANT)
When starting a new conversation, paste:

- `CHAVRUTRAIL_SPEC.md`
- `DECISIONS.md`
- `STATUS.md`

Then say:
> “Continue from STATUS → Next Steps. Do not re-ask resolved questions.”

That’s the cleanest way to “load context”.

### Next technical step (when ready)
We’ll now:
- fetch `profiles` after login
- display `display_name`
- update it from the app

Say **“Continue to profile read/update”** when you’re ready.
