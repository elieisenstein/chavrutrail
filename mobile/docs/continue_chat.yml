## Why this status is “right-sized”
- It documents **only what actually works**
- It clearly marks Rides as *Core MVP* (not “done forever”)
- It leaves space for Join, Filters, Preferences, Chat, etc. without implying they exist

When you’re ready, next logical section to add later will be:

```md
## Next Milestones
- Join / Request Join flow
- Ride participants view (owner)
- Feed filtering & polish
